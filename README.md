# Electric Vehicle Sales Data Analysis (India)

This project focuses on analyzing state-level electric vehicle (EV) sales data in India from 2014 to 2023. The analysis aims to uncover sales trends, regional performance, and growth patterns within the electric vehicle market.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: State-level EV sales data for the years 2014â€“2023.
- **Objective**: Analyze the sales trends, identify high and low-performing regions, and create insightful visualizations to represent the growth rate and patterns across various states and vehicle classes.
  
## Key Tasks & Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and optimized data types for better performance.
   - Removed data related to partial years to maintain accuracy and consistency.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Identified trends in state-wise EV sales, highlighting the highest and lowest sales regions.
   - Performed growth rate analysis to understand the pace of EV adoption across different states.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Used Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create clear, visual representations of:
     - Annual and monthly EV sales patterns.
     - Sales performance across different vehicle categories.
     - Growth trends for EV sales over the years.
   
4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Converted columns with fewer unique values into categorical types to improve data handling and performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Insights & Findings
- Visualizations highlighted distinct regional variations in EV sales, with some states showing rapid growth while others lagged behind.
- Vehicle class-specific trends provided insights into which types of EVs are most popular in different regions.
- Growth rate analysis revealed significant acceleration in EV sales in certain states, especially in the last few years.
